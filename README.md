👋🏼

I’m Paul - a software engineer currently building things with Tide Cleaners. A few years ago I was in working in customer service and I decided to learn how to code with Treehouse. I've been a developer on all kinds of projects from enterprise .NET applications to large Next.js apps.

I'm currently learning Go and AWS.
