I'm a software engineer at Portion Capital, where I build web applications that solve business needs for our portfolio companies. I'm passionate about building products that are easy to use and solve real problems.

As a developer, I focus my energy on mastering the Web Platform, TypeScript, and servers, and am currently studying Go to broaden my skillset in functional programming. I'm also interested in developer experience, application architecture, and web accessibility.

I grew up in the oil fields of West Texas, and now live in Richardson, TX with my wife, son, and daughter. I enjoy spending time with family, cycling, and playing music.
