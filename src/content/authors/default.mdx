I'm a software engineer at Capital One, where I build web experiences in auto refinance. I'm passionate about building products that are easy to use and solve real problems.

As a developer, I focus my energy on mastering the Web Platform and TypeScript. I'm also interested in developer experience, application architecture, and web accessibility.

I grew up in the oil fields of West Texas, and now live in Richardson, TX with my wife, son, and daughter. I enjoy spending time with family, cycling, and playing music.
